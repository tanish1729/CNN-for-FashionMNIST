# Convolutional Neural Network
## Trained and Tested on FashionMNIST Dataset
---  
- `data/` contains the downloaded dataset  
- `models/` contains the saved CNN model  
- `CNN.ipynb` contains the code for the entire project
---
- We start off by gathering and visualising the data.
- Then, the first model we train is a simple linear model followed by the second model in which we introduce non-linearities.
- Finally, we build a CNN with convolutional and maxpooling layers.
- All 3 models are then compared on their final loss, accuracy and time taken.
- We also make predictions and plot a confusion matrix for our CNN.
